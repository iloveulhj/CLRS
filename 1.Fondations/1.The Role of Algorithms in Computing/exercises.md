# 1. The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## 1.1 Algorithms
* 1.1-1. Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.
	* sorting: 스마트폰의 연락처
	* computing a convex hull: ...
* 1.1-2. Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?
	* 메모리 효율
* 1.1-3. Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.
	* 배열
		* 장점: 읽기, 쓰기작업시에 어느 인덱스든 한 번에 접근이 가능하다.
		* 단점: 미리 메모리 공간을 할당해야 한다.
* 1.1-4. How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?
	* shortest-path:
	* traveling-salesman problem:
* 1.1-5. Come up with real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.
