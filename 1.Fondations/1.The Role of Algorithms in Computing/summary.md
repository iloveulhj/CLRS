# 1. The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## 1.1 Algorithms
* sequence of computational step that transform the input into the ouput
* `Data Structures`: No single data structure works well for all purposes, and so it is important to know the strengths and limitations of several of them
* `Hard problems`
	* NP-complete problem has ever been found, nobody has ever proven that an efficient algorithm for one cannot exist.
	* You should know about NP-complete problems because some of them arise surprisingly often in real applications. If you can show that the problem is NP-complete, you can instead spend your time developing an efficient algorithm that gives a good, but not the best possible, solution.
	* `traveling-salesman problem` is NP-complete.

## 1.2 Algorithms as a technology
* Efficiency
	* Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efficiency.
	* insertion sort(n^2), merge sort(nlgn)
* With the ever-increasing capacities of computers, we use them to
solve larger problems than ever before
